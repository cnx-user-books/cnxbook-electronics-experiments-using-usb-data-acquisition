<title>Introduction</title>
<para id="id2435240">One common measurement that scientists and
engineers like to make is temperature. For example, it may be
necessary to record the temperature of a biology experiment, a heat
testing chamber for electronics, or a jet engine.</para>
<para id="id8866305">In order to convert temperature information
into electrical form, a transducer is needed. A temperature
transducer is simply a sensor that will allow the user a mechanism
to detect a temperature change (increasing or decreasing voltage,
current, resistance, etc).</para>
<para id="id7377201">During this exercise, the experimenters will
use the integrated circuit LM34CZ temperature sensor to output a
linear, temperature dependent voltage. This voltage will be
digitized by a Low Cost USB DAQ so that measurements can be taken
on a computer. Finally, a LabVIEW virtual instrument (VI) will be
created in order to visualize sampled data and control several
LEDs.</para>

<title>Pre-Lab Assignment</title>
<para id="id9671755">1) Many types of temperature sensors exist,
including RTDs, thermocouples, thermistors, and ICs. Use any
resources available (textbooks, the web, etc) to research each type
of transducer and prepare a short written summary of each.</para>
<para id="id9313852">2) Find and print the datasheet for the LM34CZ
temperature sensor using Google. By reading the datasheet, can you
determine how we will measure temperature with this IC? Write a
formula relating temperature and sensor output voltage (this should
be fairly simple).</para>
<para id="id8756937">3) Suppose we were using the LM35 temperature
sensor instead. Obtain the datasheet and write a second formula
relating temperature and sensor output voltage for the LM35.</para>
<para id="id6577178">4) Become familiar with the National
Instruments USB 6008 and 6009 data acquisition devices. These
datasheets are available at 
<link url="http://www.ni.com/">www.ni.com</link>.</para>

<title>Theory</title>
<para id="id6369672">One method to measure temperature involves
using an integrated circuit transducer such as the LM34CZ. This IC
will generate a voltage that is linearly proportional to the
measured temperature. Compared to other measurement methods, ICs
provide an extremely linear output with very little error. They are
also one of the simplest temperature sensors to connect and
use.</para>
<para id="id6230157">Below are several views of the LM34CZ in a
TO-92 package:</para>

<para id="id9702859">As the experimenter can see, the LM34CZ is a
three-terminal device. Two pins are used for power (+Vs and GND),
while the third pin is used to output a temperature dependent
voltage.</para>
<para id="id9469937">Since the LM34CZ outputs a voltage that is
linearly dependent with temperature, it is easy to compute measured
temperature from sensor output voltage or vice versa. In fact, the
LM34CZ ideally outputs exactly 10mV / deg F.</para>

<caption> Temperature - Voltage Relationship </caption></figure>
<para id="id9709710">To visualize this relationship, a graph sensor
output voltage vs. temperature can be plotted using LabVIEW:</para>

<title>Laboratory Exercise</title>
<para id="id6473576">During this exercise, the experimenter will
construct an LED thermometer that resembles the following:</para>

<caption> LED Thermometer Front Panel in LabVIEW </caption></figure>
<para id="id7402027">1) In order to create the LED thermometer
output, Connect LEDs and resistors to the digital output lines of
the Low Cost USB DAQ as shown below. Each LED will be programmed to
light up when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.</para>
<figure id="id2739577"><media id="idm9332880" alt=""><image src="../../media/Graphic6-9e0b.png" mime-type="image/png"/></media>
<caption> LED Connection Schematic </caption></figure>
<para id="id9461801">2) To measure the temperature, connect the
LM34CZ IC to the Low Cost USB DAQ as shown below. Note that the +5V
supply needed by the IC can be obtained directly from the National
Instruments USB 6008 or 6009.</para>
<figure id="id3485905"><media id="idm1174288" alt=""><image src="../../media/Graphic7.png" mime-type="image/png"/></media>
<caption> Temperature Sensor Schematic </caption></figure>
<para id="id9595664">3) Using the DAQ Assistant Express VI, create
the following LabVIEW block diagram. In this virtual instrument
(VI), temperature data is acquired using the Low Cost USB DAQ,
scaled, and displayed on a chart. The temperature measurement is
also compared with several thresholds. Once the temperature exceeds
each threshold, a corresponding physical LED and front panel LED
will light up.</para>

<caption> LED Thermometer Block Diagram in LabVIEW </caption></figure>
<para id="id6186846">4) Run the VI and adjust the threshold levels
so that several LEDs light up. Warm up the temperature sensor by
squeezing it with your fingers and observe the rise in measured
temperature on the front panel chart. You have now succeeded in
creating an LED thermometer!</para>

<title>Post-Lab Questions</title>
<para id="id9616207">1) Did the measured temperature levels match
what you expected? If the temperature is warmer or cooler than you
expected, elaborate on possible sources of error.</para>
<para id="id8859150">2) Look at the LED Thermometer VI created
above, and determine how often temperature measurements are being
taken. Why wouldnâ€™t you want to take room temperature measurements
at a faster rate such as 1 MHz?</para>
<para id="id8648852">3) If you were incorporating the LM34CZ
temperature sensor into a shipping product, what would you do to
calibrate the sensor? Outline the process you would go through to
make your temperature measurements more accurate.</para>
<para id="id9829767">4) How could you modify the LabVIEW virtual
instrument above to output a Centigrade or Farenheit temperature
depending on user input? Assume you are using the same LM34CZ
temperature sensor.</para>
